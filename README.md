# Restaurant-management-System
A small project developed for my university course to manage restaurant operations. Features menu management, order processing, billing, inventory tracking, and user role management. Focuses on enhancing efficiency and user experience using modern technologies.
Abstract
 In a bustling urban environment, a quaint restaurant seeks to streamline its operations through an efficient
 restaurant management system developed in C programming. This system encompasses core functionalities
 including user management, menu handling, order processing, inventory tracking, and payment processing.
 The system enables admin personnel to manage menu items by inserting, updating, or deleting item details.
 Customers interact with a user-friendly interface to browse the menu, place orders, and receive calculated
 totals, including optional discounts for students. Orders are uniquely identified and stored, allowing seamless
 retrieval and management.
 The payment module empowers cashiers to process transactions using various methods, including cash and
 mobile banking, with an option for customers to add tips. Successful payments trigger automatic updates to
 the inventory. The system provides staff with a comprehensive view of all orders, aiding in efficient order
 fulfillment. Payment and user details are persistently stored using file handling, ensuring data integrity and
 continuity. This project culminates in a reliable, user-friendly solution that enhances both customer experience
 and operational efficiency within the restaurant.
